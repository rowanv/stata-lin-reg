This repository includes the STATA code for my 17.871: Quantitative Research Methods project. The do files clean the database and run a linear regression. The analysis in undertaken in order to study the efficacy of the diversified education system in Venezuelan schools.

Abstract:

There has been extensive research on mechanisms to increasing accessibility to education in Latin
America, but fewer studies have analyzed the efficacy of systems currently in place. This study identifies the effects of Venezuela’s diversified education system on academic performance. It utilizes individual student-level data from the national college entrance exam as a performance metric. I find a 1.2% decrease in performance for scientific track students, as compared to humanistic track students. When demographic, family environment, and regional effects are taken into account the decrease in performance is still present. The results are highly statistically significant, with a p value of less than 0.01. I theorize that the humanistic track leads to increased gains in academic performance, contingent on the national college entrance exam’s ability to accurately measure academic performance.
